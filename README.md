# 🚌 Bus Reservation System (Java)

## 📌 About the Project

The **Bus Reservation System** is a Java-based application developed to streamline the process of reserving seats on buses. It aims to automate the manual ticket booking process, reduce human error, and offer a simple and efficient way for users to book, cancel, and manage their bus reservations.

## 💡 Why I Made This Project

In many parts of the world, especially in semi-urban and rural areas, bus ticket booking is still managed manually — often via handwritten registers or basic spreadsheets. This leads to:

- Double bookings or overbooking
- Inaccurate availability tracking
- Lack of real-time access to booking status
- Time-consuming and inefficient processes

This project was created to **solve these issues** by providing a software-based solution that improves reliability, speed, and ease of managing bus reservations.

## 🧠 Key Features

- ✅ Add new buses with seat and route details
- ✅ View available buses and their statuses
- ✅ Book and cancel tickets with real-time seat availability
- ✅ Prevent double bookings
- ✅ Simple and user-friendly console-based UI
- ✅ Data validation and error handling

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Language:** Java
- **Paradigm:** Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- **Data Structures:** ArrayLists, HashMaps, and custom objects
- **Interface:** Command-Line Interface (CLI)

## 🚀 How It Solves Real-World Problems

- **Efficiency:** Speeds up the reservation process
- **Accuracy:** Reduces chances of human error in booking and seat assignment
- **Scalability:** Can be extended with GUI, database, or web interface
- **Accessibility:** Allows users or agents to manage bookings from a centralized system

## 📈 Future Enhancements

- GUI using JavaFX or Swing
- Integration with a relational database (MySQL/PostgreSQL)
- User authentication and role-based access
- Online booking via web interface (Spring Boot)
